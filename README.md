# Face Tracking

### What this program is

This program is written in Python and uses OpenCV to create real time facial tracking from a USB. I'm using the Haar Classifier from OpenCV to accomplish this.



### How to run it

Python is a prerequisite to be able to run this program. You can download it from: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

OpenCV is another prerequisite. You can download it from here: https://opencv.org/releases/. Make sure you observe OpenCV file dependencies within the program.

Simply type `python cameraFacialDetectionTest.py` when you have a USB camera plugged into your computer (a laptop webcam will work for this too).

All of the other files in this repository were stepping stones to get to the final product of face tracking.
